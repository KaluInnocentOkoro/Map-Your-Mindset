Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/fYOfufIvmboPDgc8bIS9Tw "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

### General:

-   What is a Pseudocode?
-   why is Pseudocoding important in programming?
-   How do you write Pseudocodes?

### Quiz questions

**Great!** You've completed the quiz successfully! Keep going! (Show quiz)

Tasks
-----

### 0\. Being a square keeps you from going around in circles.

mandatory

To develop an algorithm

**calculate the sum of squares of given input of numbers**

you are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

-   Create the algorithm in a flow chart save a screen shot and upload it to google drive, and give access to anyone with the link
-   Create pseudo code in a google doc and and give access to anyone with the link

### 1\. Order marches with weighty and measured strides. Disorder is always in a hurry.

mandatory

To develop an algorithm that

**reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order**

you are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

-   Create the algorithm in a flow chart save a screen shot and upload it to google drive, and give access to anyone with the link
-   Create pseudo code in a google doc and and give access to anyone with the link

### 2\. It is not enough to run; one must start in time

mandatory

To develop an algorithm

**Calculate a running sum**

A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result

you are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

-   Create the algorithm in a flow chart save a screen shot and upload it to google drive, and give access to anyone with the link
-   Create pseudo code in a google doc and and give access to anyone with the link
